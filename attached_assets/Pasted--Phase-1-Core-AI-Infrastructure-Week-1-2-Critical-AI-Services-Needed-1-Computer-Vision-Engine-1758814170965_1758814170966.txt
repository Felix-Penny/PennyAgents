ðŸš€ Phase 1: Core AI Infrastructure (Week 1-2)
Critical AI Services Needed:
1. Computer Vision Engine:

Primary: Amazon Rekognition (fastest to MVP)
Facial detection/recognition âœ…
Object detection (weapons, bags) âœ…
Emotion/behavior analysis âœ…
Alternative: Google Cloud Vision API or custom YOLO models
2. Video Processing:

FFmpeg for frame extraction (1-5 FPS sampling)
MediaMTX for RTSP â†’ WebRTC live streaming
TURN server configuration for reliable WebRTC
3. Gait Recognition:

Phase 1: Person re-identification using ResNet50 backbone
Phase 2: OpenGait framework for true gait signatures
ðŸ›  Technical Architecture:
Backend AI Microservices (Python FastAPI):
/ai-services/
â”œâ”€â”€ face-recognition/     # InsightFace + AWS Rekognition
â”œâ”€â”€ object-detection/     # YOLOv8 + ByteTrack  
â”œâ”€â”€ behavioral-analysis/  # Rule-based + action recognition
â”œâ”€â”€ gait-analysis/        # OpenGait framework
â””â”€â”€ predictive-analytics/ # Prophet/ARIMA forecasting
Integration Points:
Express API â†’ AI microservices via REST
WebSocket for real-time alerts/overlays
Object Storage for video clips and face templates
PostgreSQL for embeddings and tracking data
ðŸ“‹ Implementation Phases:
Phase 1: Live Detection (Weeks 1-2)
Priority: Live Feeds + Facial Recognition

Real Capabilities:

âœ… Live object detection (people, weapons, suspicious items)
âœ… Real-time facial recognition with confidence scores
âœ… Live bounding box overlays on video streams
âœ… Instant alerts for known offenders
Technical Tasks:

Set up Amazon Rekognition integration
Build video frame sampling pipeline
Connect live streams to AI processing
Real-time overlay rendering
Phase 2: Advanced Analysis (Weeks 3-4)
Priority: Behavioral Analysis + Gait Recognition

Real Capabilities:

âœ… Behavioral pattern detection (loitering, running, crowding)
âœ… Person re-identification across camera views
âœ… Gait-based tracking for suspect following
âœ… Automated incident generation
Phase 3: Intelligence (Weeks 5-6)
Priority: Predictive Analytics + Network Intelligence

Real Capabilities:

âœ… Threat prediction based on historical patterns
âœ… Risk scoring by time/location/behavior
âœ… Cross-location intelligence sharing
âœ… Actionable recommendations
ðŸ’° Cost Considerations:
AWS Rekognition Pricing:
Face Detection: $0.001 per image
Face Recognition: $0.001 per face searched
Object Detection: $0.001 per image
Estimated Monthly: $200-500 for moderate usage
Alternative Cost-Effective Options:
Open Source: DeepFace + YOLO (self-hosted)
Hybrid: Rekognition for facial + custom models for behavior
ðŸ”§ Required Integrations:
AWS Services (via Replit integration)
Object Storage (already configured)
WebRTC/Media Streaming setup
Python AI Services deployment
ðŸ“Š MVP Success Metrics:
Live Feeds:
âœ… <1 second latency for object detection overlays
âœ… 95%+ uptime for video streams
âœ… Real bounding boxes around detected objects
Facial Recognition:
âœ… Face enrollment from uploaded photos
âœ… Real-time matching with confidence scores >85%
âœ… Instant alerts for watchlist matches
Behavioral Analysis:
âœ… Loitering detection (>30 seconds stationary)
âœ… Suspicious behavior alerts (running, weapons)
âœ… Evidence clips auto-generated
Predictive Analytics:
âœ… 7-day threat forecasts with accuracy metrics
âœ… Risk heat maps by location/time
âœ… Actionable security recommendations
ðŸš¦ Next Steps:
