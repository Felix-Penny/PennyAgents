‚ùå FAKE FUNCTIONALITY (Static/Mock Data)
Sales, Operations, HR Agents
Hardcoded data - All metrics, charts, and statistics are static JavaScript objects
No backend integration - Despite having API routes, frontends don't call them
Non-functional buttons - All action buttons are UI-only with no backend logic
Static progress bars - All progress indicators show fixed values
Security Agent Features
Mock camera feeds - No actual video streaming infrastructure
Simulated alerts - Alert data exists in schema but no real-time detection
Fake offender detection - No AI/ML integration for face recognition
Static incident management - Database schema exists but no real workflow
Business Process Automation
Simulated workflows - All "active processes" and "system status" are hardcoded
Fake integrations - No actual POS, inventory, or third-party service connections
Mock notifications - Alert system UI without real-time delivery
Static analytics - All charts and reports show predetermined values
üö´ COMPLETELY MISSING FUNCTIONALITY
Core Business Logic
AI/ML Detection Systems - No computer vision, threat detection, or pattern recognition
Real-time Video Processing - No actual camera integration or stream analysis
Payment Processing - Stripe integration exists but no functional payment flows
Email/SMS Notifications - SendGrid integration available but not implemented
File Upload/Storage - No evidence storage or document management
Advanced Features
Cross-store Intelligence Sharing - Network features are schema-only
Automated Workflows - No actual process automation or triggers
Reporting & Analytics - No data visualization or business intelligence
Integration APIs - No connections to external business systems
Mobile Responsiveness - Limited mobile optimization
Production Readiness
Data Seeding/Migration - No sample data population scripts
Error Logging - No centralized error tracking or monitoring
Performance Optimization - No caching, optimization, or scalability features
Testing Suite - No automated tests for functionality validation
Documentation - No API documentation or user guides
üìä CURRENT STATE SUMMARY
Real vs Fake Ratio: ~20% Real, 80% Fake/Missing

What Actually Works:
User can login with admin/admin
Platform shows all 5 agent cards
Finance dashboard loads live data from the backend
Proper authentication and routing between agents
Database persistence for users, agents, and configurations
What Looks Real But Isn't:
Sales, Operations, HR dashboards (beautiful UI, zero backend integration)
Security monitoring features (comprehensive UI, no real functionality)
All action buttons and interactive elements (UI-only, no functionality)
Progress bars, charts, and metrics (hardcoded values)
Technical Debt:
45 TypeScript compilation errors across backend files
Missing database seeding for realistic demo data
API routes exist but aren't consumed by frontend components
WebSocket server setup but no real-time features implemented
