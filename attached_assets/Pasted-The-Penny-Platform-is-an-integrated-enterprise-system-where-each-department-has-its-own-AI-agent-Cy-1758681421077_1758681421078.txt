The Penny Platform is an integrated enterprise system where each department has its own AI agent (Cyber-Security, On-site Security, Finance, Operations, HR, Sales, Marketing). Each agent is a specialized “digital employee” with a dedicated knowledge base (via RAG) and workflows. The platform is a React SPA (Material-UI), FastAPI backend, AWS Cognito SSO, PostgreSQL/Redis, with AI/ML models (domain-specific, LLMs) and real-time WebSockets. Below are the detailed MVP specs for each agent, the overall platform, the client-facing website, and development guidance for Replit AI integration.

Cyber-Security Agent

Overview: An AI-driven Cybersecurity Agent automates threat detection, incident response, and compliance monitoring. It continuously analyzes network logs, endpoint data, and threat intelligence feeds to identify anomalies, unauthorized access, malware, and vulnerabilities. The agent uses LLM and ML models for contextual analysis (e.g. SIEM, IDS alerts) and references a RAG knowledge base of security policies and attack signatures
exabeam.com
redcanary.com
. This frees human analysts from repetitive triage tasks and speeds up investigations.

System Architecture:

Core Components: React 18.2 SPA dashboard; FastAPI (async) server; PostgreSQL for events/logs; Redis cache for session and lookups; AWS S3 for logs/backups; containerized on AWS ECS. AI/ML models include anomaly detection, malware classification, and an LLM for analysis. A retrieval-augmented knowledge base stores policies, known CVEs, threat feeds, and past incidents
aws.amazon.com
.

Authentication & Roles: AWS Cognito SSO (OAuth 2.0 Hosted UI). Roles include Security Admin (manage org-wide settings), SOC Analyst (investigate alerts), Threat Hunter (proactively research), Auditor (read-only reports). Role-based controls restrict data scope per department or region.

Data Ingestion: Integrates with SIEM/XDR (via APIs or log forwarding) to ingest logs, intrusion alerts, user activity. Also pulls threat intelligence feeds (IP blacklists, malware databases). Network telemetry can come from firewalls, IDS/IPS, endpoints.

Dashboards & Analytics:

Security Overview: KPIs on total threats detected, active incidents, time-to-detect/response. Trend charts of attacks by type (malware, phishing, intrusion)
exabeam.com
.

Network Activity: Visualize traffic anomalies, geolocation of attacks, and current attack heatmap.

Incident Trends: Line charts for weekly/monthly incidents vs. false positives. Filter by category (internal threat, external breach).

Compliance Reports: One-click reports for PCI-DSS, ISO 27001, GDPR exposures.

Threat Detection & Response:

Real-time Monitoring: Continuously analyze logs and use ML to detect deviations from baseline behaviors (user logins, data access patterns)
exabeam.com
. Alert on suspicious activities (e.g. unusual admin privileges, lateral movement).

Automated Triage: Upon an alert, the agent gathers context (user history, device info, related alerts) automatically
redcanary.com
. It can classify severity and suggest initial actions.

SOC Playbooks: Built-in playbooks for common incidents (ransomware, credential compromise). The agent can execute routine steps (e.g. isolate a machine, reset credentials) or present suggestions to analysts.

LLM Assistance: Analysts can query the agent in natural language (e.g. “Summarize this spike in failed logins”) and it will answer using up-to-date intel from the RAG KB, improving situational awareness.

Incident Management:

Creation: Automatic creation of incident tickets when threshold exceeded. Capture type (malware, breach), assets affected, timestamps, initial evidence.

Workflow: States (New → Investigating → Resolved/Closed). Assign to analysts, track remediation steps. Audit trail of actions and notes.

Response Coordination: Integration with ticketing systems (Jira, ServiceNow) for cross-team coordination.

Compliance & Reporting:

Auto-generate audit logs of all security events.

Development Roadmap

1. Project Setup:

Create Replit project with monorepo or separate services (frontend, backend, agents).

Initialize Git repository and major frameworks (React, FastAPI). Commit checkpoints after each stage.

2. Authentication Module (Priority):

Configure AWS Cognito User Pool (with Hosted UI) for SSO.

Implement login flow in React (redirect to Cognito, handle callback).

Set up role-based permissions on backend using Cognito JWT claims.

3. Backend Foundations:

Scaffold FastAPI app; define core data models (User, Organization, etc.) in PostgreSQL.

Implement database migrations (e.g. Alembic).

Set up Redis for caching.

Deploy initial services on local Docker/ECS with test endpoints.

4. Agent-Specific Backends:

For each agent (Security, Finance, etc.), create separate FastAPI modules/services with their data models (e.g. Incident, Transaction, Order).

Integrate AI/ML stubs: include placeholder functions for model inference or LLM queries.

Build RAG pipeline: attach vector store for each domain (documents, policies). Test retrieval + LLM step
aws.amazon.com
.

5. Frontend UI:

Design global layout (header with nav, sidebar with agent list, content area).

Implement common components (data tables, charts with a library like Recharts or Chart.js).

For each agent, create initial pages: Dashboard, List views (incidents, invoices, etc.), detail modals.

Integrate Material-UI theme and responsive breakpoints (xs, sm, md).

6. Real-Time Updates:

Add WebSocket support on backend (FastAPI WebSocket endpoints).

In React, connect to socket for live alerts (e.g. security alert feed). Use Redux/RTK Query for state, optimistic updates for actions.

7. AI/ML Integration:

Integrate computer vision model (for security cameras) or set up mock API endpoints.

Connect to LLM APIs (OpenAI/GPT) for tasks like report generation or chat. Use RAG: build simple vector DB (e.g. Pinecone or open-source) with sample docs.

Implement feedback loop: UI for staff to label alerts as true/false, store for retraining.

8. Reporting & Export:

Build report generator: backend endpoints producing PDF/CSV of key metrics.

Frontend: allow users to schedule or export data (daily, weekly).

9. Documentation & QA:

Write developer docs and API specs.

Conduct QA testing (unit tests, integration tests).

Iterate UI/UX based on usability feedback.

10. Deployment:

Containerize services, deploy on AWS ECS clusters.

Configure CI/CD (Replit Github integration or AWS pipelines).

Set up monitoring (CloudWatch logs, alerts on errors).

Throughout development, use Replit AI agents: start with its “Design & Iterate” mode for each major feature, then switch to “Build Full App” for integration. Use the Assistant for small code fixes or clarifications.

Replit AI Collaboration & Best Practices

Effective Prompting: When instructing Replit’s AI, be specific and detailed. For example, say “Implement OAuth login using AWS Cognito in FastAPI” rather than “Add login.” Break tasks down: first configure Cognito, then handle callback, then store user profiles. Provide context in prompts (e.g., snippets of error messages or code structure) so the AI understands your project. Iteratively refine prompts based on the AI’s responses.

Agent vs. Assistant: Use the AI Agent for large, new features (e.g. “Build the incidents module from scratch”). Use the AI Assistant for minor tasks (fixing bugs, refactoring). Agents can follow high-level SOPs; assistants excel at explaining or debugging specific code lines.

Checkpoints: Regularly save project Checkpoints in Replit. After completing a feature (like authentication), create a checkpoint. This way you can experiment freely knowing you can roll back if needed.

Monitor Progress: Keep an eye on the agent’s activity feed to understand what changes it’s making. This helps catch mistakes early. If the agent misunderstands, pause it and clarify with more context or examples.

Development Best Practices:

Start Simple: Implement core functionality first. For example, get a basic login, a simple incident list, and one working ML alert. Then layer on complexity (RBAC, detailed analytics).

Understand Generated Code: Even if AI writes code, review and test it yourself. Ensure you understand the logic and fix any edge cases.

Clean, Modular Code: Organize code into clear modules (each agent its own FastAPI app, shared UI components). Comment complex logic. This helps both human and AI collaborators.

Iterative Debugging: Expect to debug. Provide error messages to the AI and ask it to trace issues. Use print/log statements or debuggers if needed.

Don’t Over-rely: Use AI as a collaborator, not an oracle. Always validate its outputs. Combine its suggestions with your domain knowledge (especially for security and compliance).

By following these guidelines, you can effectively leverage Replit AI to accelerate development while maintaining control over the architecture and code quality.
